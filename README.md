# Bakery Landing page

This is a landing page of a Bakery for a small business owners, they can offer their services, show their products, and get the customer to know them through the biography part. The customer also can contact the small business owners through the form placed in the contact part. 
Customers can visualize the social networks.
To make this project I used Bootstrap, HTML and CSS.

## Features

Users can use the navigation bar to travel into the site. <br />
The landing page is responsive. <br />
I used cards to put the offered service's content, so once the user give it a click, the content is highlighted. <br/>
Images used in the gallery have a special effect of hover adding a nice close to the image.<br/>
A contact form is added, so the customer can let his/her information and submit it. <br/>
Logo, email address of the owner's business and social networks are placed next to the contact form.
